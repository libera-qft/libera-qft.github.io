## Joining the group

There aren't any requirements or sign-up procedures for joining the group, you
should just be willing to present one of the topics that are yet to come up (see
the [schedule]({{< relref "schedule" >}})). We highly recommend dropping by the
either the [IRC](irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/##qft) (`##qft` on
`irc.libera.chat`) or [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/##qft:libera.chat)
chat room (they're bridged) before joining one of the seminars so you can get up
to speed with the current state of the group.
